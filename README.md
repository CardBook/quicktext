[Quicktext](https://addons.thunderbird.net/addon/quicktext/) is a [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/) extension, which has been created by Emil Hesslow. However, he was no longer able to update Quicktext or provide any kind of support. Thankfully he changed the license of Quicktext to MPL 2.0, so I could continue to update the extension and make it work with the most recent version of Thunderbird.

**Note**: Emil maintained two versions of Quicktext, a free “Standard” version and a paid “Pro” version with additional features. Since he released both versions under MPL 2.0, the [official version of Quicktext](https://addons.thunderbird.net/addon/quicktext/) is based on the “Pro” version. However, the name of the extension remains just “Quicktext”. The obsolete "Standard" branch of Quicktext will not receive any further updates.
